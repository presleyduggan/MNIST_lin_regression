# MNIST_machine-learning

This repository contains a few ML projects using MNIST data that I have done. More information about MNIST data can be found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

KNN:
Uses KNN implemented by hand to try to guess MNIST data (10 labels)
shows accuracy

Linear_Regression:
Uses linear regression implemented by hand to try to guess MNIST data (only 2 labels)
10-fold cross validation and shows accuracy

SVM:
Uses SVM implemented from sklearn to try to guess MNIST data (10 labels)
5-fold cross validation and shows accuracy between 3 different SVM kernels (linear, poly, and rbf)
